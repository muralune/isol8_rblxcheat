make sure you still have visual studio installed

YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD 2 THINGS:

i made it easy for u ayden in the isol8_rblx folder i made
a "requirements" folder with installers in there all you have to do
is run and install "dotnet-runtime-7.0.0-win-x64", and "VC_redist.x64"

_________________________________________________________________________
.NET runtime = making the app able to open

redist = in minecraft terms downloading the 
         missing textures for a server but in
         this case code



my bad ayden, this is prob really complicated but only cuz roblox 
stupid byfron, but ig it works pretty good planning on addind new 
features dm me if u want first dibs.
